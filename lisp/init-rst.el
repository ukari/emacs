;; Emacs support for reStructuredText is implemented as an Emacs major mode (rst-mode) provided by the rst.el Emacs package.

;; Emacs distributions contain rst.el since version V23.1. However, a significantly updated version of rst.el is contained in Emacs V24.3. This document describes the version of rst.el contained in Emacs V24.3 and later versions. This version of rst.el has the internal version V1.4.1.

;; If you have Emacs V24.3 or later you do not need to install anything to get reST support. If you have an Emacs between V23.1 and V24.2 you may use the version of rst.el installed with Emacs or install a more recent one locally (recommended). In other cases you need to install rst.el locally to get reST support.
